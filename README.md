# CI-CD

## Description

Our CI-CD is inspired by developers who want to save time and money running quality checks prior merging to main or any other important branch. We created this project because we want to familiarize with Continuous Integration and Continuous Deployment that are  common practices in nowaday development. We resolved the hours running local tests and the consistency of running a test everytime we push a request to main branch. We learned that GitHub Actions is very reliable on running tests consistently and pointing out where we can have conflicts before merge with the main branch.
